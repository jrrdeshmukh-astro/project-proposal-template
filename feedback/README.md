# Feedback

This directory is dedicated to storing and managing feedback related to the project.

## Purpose

This directory serves as a central location for collecting and organizing feedback from various sources, including:

*   **Client Feedback:** Comments and suggestions from the client.
*   **User Feedback:** Input from users or testers.
*   **Internal Reviews:** Feedback from team members or stakeholders.

## Organization

Feedback can be organized in several ways within this directory:

*   **By Date:** Create subdirectories for specific dates or feedback periods (e.g., `feedback/2024-10-26/`).
*   **By Source:** Create subdirectories for different feedback sources (e.g., `feedback/client/`, `feedback/user-testing/`).
*   **By File/Feature:** If feedback is specific to certain files or features, you can create subdirectories accordingly.

## Format

Feedback can be stored in various formats:

*   **Text Files (`.txt`, `.md`):** For simple text-based feedback.
*   **Spreadsheets (`.csv`, `.xlsx`):** For structured feedback with ratings or other data.
*   **Documents (`.docx`, `.pdf`):** For more formal feedback reports.

## Using Issues (Recommended)

For more structured feedback and discussion, it's highly recommended to use the issue tracking system of your Git repository (e.g., GitHub Issues, GitLab Issues). This allows for:

*   **Clear Tracking:** Issues can be assigned, labeled, and tracked through different stages.
*   **Discussion Threads:** Comments and discussions can be organized within each issue.
*   **Integration with Code:** Issues can be linked to specific code changes or commits.

Therefore, this `feedback` directory should primarily be used for storing larger feedback documents or when an issue tracker isn't readily available.
