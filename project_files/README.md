# Project Files

This directory contains all working files, source code, assets, and other materials related to the project.

## Organization

The contents of this directory may be further organized into subdirectories based on project type or specific needs. Here are some common examples:

*   **`src/`:** Contains source code files (e.g., `.js`, `.py`, `.html`, `.css`).
*   **`assets/`:** Contains images, videos, audio files, and other media assets.
*   **`docs/`:** Contains project documentation, specifications, and user manuals.
*   **`data/`:** Contains data files used by the project.
*   **`build/` or `dist/`:** Contains compiled or built project outputs.

This structure is a suggestion and can be adapted as needed to best suit the project's requirements.

## File Naming Conventions

To maintain clarity and consistency, please adhere to the following file naming conventions (where applicable):

*   Use lowercase letters.
*   Use hyphens (`-`) to separate words (e.g., `my-project-file.txt`).
*   Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the file's purpose.
*   Use appropriate file extensions (e.g., `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.py`).
